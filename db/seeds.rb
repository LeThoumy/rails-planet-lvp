# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
Planet.create([{ name: "Mercury" }, { name: "Saturn" }, { name: "Jupiter"}, { name: "Earth"}, { name: "Mars"}])
